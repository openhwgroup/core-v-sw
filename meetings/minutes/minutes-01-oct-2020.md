Since this was a specialist meeting, it does not count towards the register of
participants in the Software Task Group.

## Meeting Summary

Members of the Software TG reviewed the draft Preliminary Project Proposal for CORE-V GNU Tool Chain development before the launch meeting.

The draft Preliminary Project Proposal can be viewed at https://github.com/jeremybennett/core-v-docs/blob/jpb-gnu-tools-ppl/program/core-v-gnu-tools-ppl.md

Phase 1 and 2 may be run in parallel (with Thales leading on phase 2) - subject to confirmation.

Whether hardware will be developed which will use the CORE-V additional instructions is not yet known. Thus there may be no interest in the additional instructions and the project may not be required.

As hardware may not exist for testing, code can be unstreamed having only been tested on a simulator

## Actions

* Duncan Bees will add the topic of whether CV32E40P cores will be created which utilise the CORE-V additional instructions to the agenda for the upcoming TWG meeting. This must be confirmed before proceeding.

* The proposal will be reviewed by the TWG on Monday 5th October

* The Project Lauch (PL) will be at end October 2020
