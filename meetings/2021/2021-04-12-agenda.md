# Agenda topics

## Register of attendance and introductions

We are recording attendance at meetings, so OpenHW Group can track membership in accordance with article 4 of the membership agreement. This matters particularly when email ballots are held, to ensure the voters represent member organizations who are active on the group. The attendance records are can be seen in the [program](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/tree/master/program) directory of the [core-v-docs repository](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs).

## OpenHW TV: 22 April 2021 (5 minutes allocated)

The Software TG will be the center of the next OpenHW TV episode.  This will allow us to reuse the work from OpenHW Day.  We are planning three 10 minute segments, followed by the usual Q&A

Ivan Kravets and Duncan Bees will report progress with the concept proposal.

## Hardware abstraction layer (10 minutes allocated)

Vice-chair of this group, Yunhai Shang, and his colleagues at Alibaba have volunteered to lead this project, for which many thanks.  They will report on progress as they move towards concept propsal approval.

## New potential projects

If time permits we will start discussion on the following topics.

- Linux

  - with the development of the CVA6 architecture, particularly its 64-bit version, this will become an urgent priority.

  - GNU tools and FreeRTOS are currently scoped for CV32E40P and need to be considered for CVA6 and CVE2.
