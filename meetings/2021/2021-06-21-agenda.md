# Agenda topics

## Register of attendance and introductions

We are recording attendance at meetings, so OpenHW Group can track membership in accordance with article 4 of the membership agreement. This matters particularly when email ballots are held, to ensure the voters represent member organizations who are active on the group. The attendance records are can be seen in the [program](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/tree/master/program) directory of the [core-v-docs repository](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs).

## Hardware abstraction layer (45 minutes allocated)

The requirements for this project will have been agreed at the meeting of 14 June 2021.  The purpose of this meeting is to agree the project concept proposal for submission to the TWG on 28 June 2021.

## Dates for future meetings

The task group meets monthly at 07:00 Pacific Time on the second Monday of the month.
