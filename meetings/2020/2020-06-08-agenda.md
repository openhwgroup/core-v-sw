## Agenda

  - **Craig Blackmore:** Carry out a detailed analysis of the work required to migrate the tool chains to the current upstream baseline and then submit the changes for incorporation.

2. Charter

A draft charter will be presented, based on the comments made at the inaugural meeting.  Comments are invited at the meeting.  The charter will then be circulated on the mailing list for ratification.

3. Tool chain support for the verification group

As a matter of urgency, the CORE-V verification group asked for assistance with a tool chain set up for their [Test Program Environment](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_program_environment.html).

Craig Blackmore has worked on this and will report on progress.

4. Program of work to upstream CORE-V tool chains

Craig Blackmore will give an update.  **Note.** The need for urgent support of verification has limited Craig's availability to work on this.
