# Software TG monthly meeting - CORE-V HAL update (Aug 2021)

## Overview

### Key activities

* Port a minimal CSI-Standard system to the Core-V hardware by Vincent & Olive. 
* "Hello World" demo is finished and can be running on the Gensys2 board. Olive will show the demo and current progress.
* Find some problems when we compiled the FreeRTOS with Core-V toolchain. Vincent had written the error logs on a document. It is preliminarily estimated that it may be caused by the version problem or configuration of Newlibc in the toolchain.
* Lastest stable bitfile of Core-V MCU is required. Thanks for the document of core-v mcu from Tim.
* Pushing the progress of RVM-CSI in the RISC-V international.

### Project status

* Initial stage -> Launch stage.

### Next stages

* Do more discussion and make the decision on which standard we will use, or wait for the progress of RVM-CSI.
* Recruit more volunteers for the project.
* Make an executable plan for the project. Do other initialization work.
