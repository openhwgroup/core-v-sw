# Software TG monthly meeting - CORE-V HAL update (Dec 2022)

## Overview

### Key activities

* RVM-CSI SIG defined an initial version of YAML relatives(including Yaml Template and Yaml Parser) to describe the target. And header files(*.h) will be generated automatically by the Yaml files. 
* RVM-CSI will give a report of project progress on the TSC. For the next step, they will do the gap analysis between the existing solutions.(I think we can share the result of our effort on this side.)
* RVM-CSI is selecting the DEV-boards(platforms) for reference implementation. It would be nice if we could add OpenHW Dev-board to the board list.

### Project status

* Initial stage -> Launch stage.

### Next stages

* Wait for initial version of HAL spec.(Maybe CPU core, Interrupt controller, Timer, Uart will included in first version spec)
* Follow the standard of RVM-CSI and implement it on Core-V hardware.
* Recruit more volunteers for the project.
