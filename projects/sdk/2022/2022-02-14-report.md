# SDK report 14 February 2022

Draft document is work in progress which covers:

- Proposed SDK Components, Main Tasks and Contributors
- Proposed SDK Development Infrastructure
- Additional sections to be completed including: SDK Project Plan, SDK Project Manager and SDK Life Cycle

## Next Steps

Next key step is to finalise second draft of the document, share to the SDK WG and arrange an SDK meeting to finalise components, tasks and contributors. We can then proceed with project plan etc.
