Create your own fork until ready to create pull request into one of these repositories â€“ all pull request must be reviewed before merging. Ensure you sign-off any pull requests to pass Eclipse foundation checks.

## -march options

All instructions must be enabled for the xcorev -march option as well as their instruction set specific option:

- hardware loop: `xcorevhwlp`
- multiply-accumulate: `xcorevmac`
- post-increment and register-indexed load/store: `xcorevpostinc`
- direct branches: `xcorevbi`
- general ALU operations: `xcorevalu`

## Other information
      
- All instructions begin with a `cv` prefix e.g. `cv.starti`/`cv.endi`
- Use GNU coding standards - https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/
- Relocation numbers are not yet fixed until a mechanism for vendor specific linker relocations in the psABI is decided
- FSF assignment must be in place before any pull requests can be accepted into the OpenHW repositories
