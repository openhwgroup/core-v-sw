# OpenHW Group Software Task Group Charter

## Ratification status

Draft of version 1 for review

##  Responsibilities

The software task group is responsible for the following parts of the OpenHW Group ecosystem

- Compiler tool chains (GNU, LLVM, proprietary) and Operating systems (RTOS, *nix, *bsd)
- Processor and platform models (ISS, cycle accurate, QEMU, OVPSim)
- IDEs (Eclipse family, PlatformIO, proprietary) and support tools
- Benchmarking (specifically including Embench)
- Demonstration applications, both bare metal and for specific operating systems.
- Support of the software ecosystem for the two OpenHW Group reference platforms, one MCU class, one APU class.

## Goals

The software task group has the following two goals.

1. To create a thriving commercial ecosystem for CORE-V software tools, models and operating systems.
2. To see those tools, models and operating systems which are open source maintained as part of official upstream distributions.

## How we achieve our goals

We expect the work to be achieved in two ways.

- Contributions in kind from member companies.
- Commercial development driven by CORE-V users.

The work will need to be carried out by the wider OpenHW community and others.  The role of the Software Task Group is the be "shepherd" of this activity.

Because this is a very large task, the Software Task Group will need to set priorities, with early selection of the tools to be supported.

## How we measure progress

We identify one short term measure of progress.

- Meeting the needs of the Verification Task Group

Strategic progress will be measured in the following ways.

- How many commercial offerings for tools are seen.
- Acceptance of open source CORE-V tools upstream.
