# OpenHW Group Software Task Group Charter

## Ratification status

Version 1: Ratified by the Software TG 13 July 2020, pending
confirmation by ballot of the TWG.

##  Responsibilities

The software task group is responsible for the following parts of the OpenHW Group ecosystem.  This includes direct support for the CORE-V instruction set extensions and a process to support users' custom instruction set extensions.

- Compiler tool chains (GNU, LLVM, proprietary) and Operating systems (RTOS, *nix, *bsd)
  - the compiler tool chain includes the assembler, linker, debugger and libraries as well as the compiler.
- Processor and platform models (ISS, cycle accurate, QEMU, OVPSim)
- IDEs (Eclipse family, PlatformIO, proprietary), their integration with the debug environment and support tools
- Benchmarking (specifically including Embench)
- Demonstration applications, both bare metal and for specific operating systems.
- Support of the software ecosystem for the two OpenHW Group reference platforms, one MCU class, one APU class.

## Goals

The software task group has the following two goals.

1. To create a thriving commercial ecosystem for CORE-V software tools, models and operating systems.
2. To see those tools, models and operating systems which are open source maintained as part of official upstream distributions.

## How we achieve our goals

We expect the work to be achieved in two ways.

- Contributions in kind from member companies.
- Commercial development driven by CORE-V users.

The work will need to be carried out by the wider OpenHW community and others.  The role of the Software Task Group is to be the "shepherd" of this activity.

**Note.** Because this is a very large task, the Software Task Group will need to set priorities, with early selection of the software to be supported first.

## How we measure progress

We identify one short term measure of progress.

- Meeting the needs of the Verification Task Group

Strategic progress will be measured in the following ways.

- How many commercial offerings for tools are seen.
- Acceptance of open source CORE-V tools upstream.
